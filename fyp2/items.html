                    one. They are rather uncommon in this
                    game, the ones in the worldsâ€™s first levels
                    can only be earned by grabbing all the

                    P-Wing not only grants the Raccoon form's abilities, but always has
                    the P-Meter filled, allowing Mario or Luigi to fly in the air without
                    the meter decreasing. A P-Wing's effects are only active for one level,
                    so after completing a level while P-Wing is active, Mario or Luigi turns
                    back into his Raccoon form. While the P-Wing has no distinct appearance
                    from the Raccoon form in the levels, the map sprite of Mario or Luigi
                    depict a large "P" on his chest while its effects are active.
