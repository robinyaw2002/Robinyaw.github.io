                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Super Mario Bros. 3 is a 2D action-adventure platform game for
                    the Famicom and NES and is the fourth installment in the Super
                    Mario series. It was released for consoles in Japan on October
                    23, 1988; in North America on February 12, 1990; and in Europe
                    and Australia on August 29, 1991. Prior to its North American
                    release on the NES, Super Mario Bros. 3 was ported to the Nintendo
                    PlayChoice-10. Being the first game in the series since Super Mario
                    Bros. not to derive its gameplay from another game, Super Mario
                    Bros. 3 retains the same level-based platformer mechanics of
                    previous titles. These core mechanics are iterated upon, featuring
                    greatly expanded levels, several new power-ups, new enemies and
                    bosses, a more fleshed-out multiplayer mode, a world map, and many
                    optional levels and secrets.

                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>Peace has returned to the Mushroom Kingdom thanks to the efforts of Mario and Luigi;
                    however, Bowser sent his own seven children (Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Lemmy,
                    and Ludwig) to the other countries of the Mushroom World, which the Mushroom Kingdom
                    forms a gateway to. The Koopalings stole the royal magic wands of the seven kings,
                    using them to transform the kings into various helpless creatures. Mario and Luigi
                    vow to go and stop the Koopalings' mischief, and change the kings back into their
                    normal form. At the end of each world, Mario and Luigi fight one of the Koopalings,
                    and after the match is over, retrieve the wand from the Koopaling to turn the king
                    back to normal. While the brothers are out in their adventure, Bowser kidnaps
                    Princess Toadstool and takes her to his lair in Dark Land. The brothers go to
                    Dark Land and fight Bowser. After defeating Bowser, they save the princess and
                    restore peace once again.
